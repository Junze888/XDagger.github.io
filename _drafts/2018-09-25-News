#### Exchange

We want to ensure people that we work continually to be added on new exchange, the next releases of our software will help us to take one more step in this way.
We would also remind you that we are actually tradeable on four exchange, two of them are for chinese customers only for now.

We actually talk with two others exchanges, both listed on coinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com to add XDAG pairs, more info as soon as possible.
Being added on this sites will give us a lot of visibility as our price is now very stable and we are still profitable to mine in front of some big others cryptocurrencies.

We will have soon an update of our wiki to explain our last progress.


Thanks to everyone who continue to support us.
Thanks to the Developer who still make some good work for us.
