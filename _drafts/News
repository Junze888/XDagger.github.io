#### Exchange

We want to ensure people that we work continually to be added on some new exchange, the next releases of our software will help us to take one more step in this way.
We would also remind you that we are actually tradeable on four exchange, two of them are for Chinese customers only for now.

#### Marketting

We would also share the recent addition of XDAG on coingecko.com, as soon as there will be more volume we on listed exchanges, we will see a price chart.

We actually talk with two others exchanges, both listed on coinmarketcap.com and coingecko.com to add XDAG pairs, more info as soon as possible.
Being added on this sites will give us a lot of visibility as our price is now very stable and we are still profitable to mine in front of some big others cryptocurrencies.

#### Giveaway
Our last giveaway goodies have been received, thanks to Antonio who was the winner of the Facebook contest.

Our developers have worked a lot this month, more than 100 commits to review and test, so next releases will be very important.
All work done is available on our GitHub: https://github.com/XDagger

We will have soon an update of our Github wiki to explain our last progress.


Thanks to everyone who continue to support us.
Thanks to the Developer who still make some good work for us.
