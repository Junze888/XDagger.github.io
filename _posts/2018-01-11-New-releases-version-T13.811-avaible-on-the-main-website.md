###### Fixes:
- 1) trouble with another address fixed (already!). If you run the program again you should obtain the same address.
- 2) some rebranding done:
- &emsp; executable renamed to xdag, xdag.exe and xdagwallet.exe
- &emsp; prompt is xdag> now
- &emsp; currency token is XDAG
- &emsp; log file is xdag.log
