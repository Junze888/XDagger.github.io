- 1) new hashrate counting system implemented; it is more precise than the existing one;  touched to:
  - &emsp; hashrate of whole network;
  - &emsp; hashrate of the node;
  - &emsp; hashrate of each miner;

- 2) option '-a address' added; this option allow the miner operate of this specific address instead of default one.
This option is dedicated to miners who have several addresses.
- &emsp; For example, second address incidentally appears after update.
- &emsp; Another example: early solo miner with much of addresses. To use this option one need to know the address and have files wallet.dat, dnet_key.dat and the storage directory.
Then, run
```$ xdag -d -m N -a address pool:port
```
- &emsp; To know all addresses one need to run the program without -a option and type the command 'account 1000' or with larger number.
- &emsp; Then, one can see balances of these addresses in the balance viewer.
- &emsp; Note for early solo-miners: loading blocks could take a time, type the 'state' command periodically.
- 3) small fixes:
- &emsp; transfer to incorrect address forbidded;
- &emsp; problem with rounding of smallest digit of amount fixed;
- &emsp; files netdb*.txt updated.

This update recommended for pools on the next planned maintenance. Miners can update if it is necessary.
